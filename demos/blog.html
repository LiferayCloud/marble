  			<p>Ask any digital designer their title and you’ll hear a dozen variations on a theme: <a href="#">Product Designer</a>, <a href="#">UX Designer</a>, Interaction Designer, Visual Designer, Visual Interaction Designer… despite the evolution of our craft into more specialized fields, we all design for screens. At Airbnb we’re Experience Designers, and this title serves as a constant reminder that although we design digital interfaces, the experiences we create extend beyond the screen. The products we build enable hosts to share their homes with guests from around the world.</p>
  			<ul>
      		<li>Bill Burnett’s <strong>Design Thinking = Method, Not Magic</strong></li>
  				<li>Tim Brown’s <em>Thoughts on Design Thinking</em></li>
  				<li>Jose Berengueres’ <em>The Innovation Formula</em></li>
  			</ul>
  			<p>When I joined Airbnb as an Experience Designer over a year ago, I was given the chance to build a new service from the ground up. The goal of this project was to create a new type of offline relationship: we wanted to connect people who have a space to share, but not the ability to host it themselves, with others who could host on their behalf. It was a rare opportunity, and it’s not often that one is able to apply service design methodologies at a tech company.</p>

  			<p>Imagine you could go on vacation for free—your entire trip paid for by earnings from your Airbnb listing. Guests could still book and enjoy your space, which would be taken care of by another host while you travel.</p>

  				<li>Next & Previous — Go back and forth between two screens.</li>
  				<li>Overlay — Show a new screen from the <strike>bottom</strike> top.</li>
  				<li>Modal — Show a modal dialog from the center.</li>
  				<li>Scroll — Scrollable artboard with anchored layers.</li>

  			<h3>Background</h3>
  			<p>As a marketplace, Airbnb relies on a healthy balance of supply and demand from our community of hosts and guests. As our community grows, we must scale in sync with growth in order to keep our occupancy rate in the right range. If our occupancy rate gets too high, it becomes difficult for guests to find the right Airbnb for their travels; too low and our hosts find it difficult to keep their spaces occupied by guests.</p>
  			<p>While our guest growth has been phenomenal, host growth poses additional challenges—millions of travelers enjoy the ability to stay with local hosts and find belonging in the places they visit, but not everyone has the ability to actively participate as hosts. We’re constantly improving our tools to make hosting easier, but let’s face it: hosting—both on our platform and offline—is hard work. It involves responsibilities like changing the sheets, replacing the towels, emptying the trash, messaging and coordinating with guests, meeting them at the door to check them in, and so much more. Every day I’m inspired by how many people open their doors to guests as Airbnb hosts. So many meaningful experiences arise when we welcome people into our homes, and yet many people who try hosting struggle with the demands it places on their busy lives. For some, these challenges prevent them from becoming an active part of our hosting community.</p>
  			<p>We knew that successfully scaling supply at Airbnb meant we had to crack the challenges of hosting to make it easier. Our hypothesis was that if we could accomplish this, perhaps hosting could cross the chasm and become more widely adopted across cultures in our busy, modern world.</p>

  			<h3>Discovery</h3>
  			<p>Ah the beginning… A greenfield project. A designer’s dream. But also, an incredibly intimidating situation. We stood at a fork in the road. We knew the general direction we wanted to move in, but there were many paths before us. How could we figure out which would be the best to take? One way we reduce ambiguity is to field sacrificial concepts. A sacrificial concept is best described as a raw idea that is visualized to provoke a response from an audience.</p>
  			<p>We brainstormed three divergent sacrificial concepts around our goal: an Airbnb-branded professional service, a directory of hospitality partners, and a marketplace of hosts from our community. All three ideas were rooted in existing products, research, or past experiments. We then tested those concepts with potential hosts, keeping their descriptions intentionally vague so we could stay as open as possible to the hopes and fears we heard as feedback.</p>
